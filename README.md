# ðŸŽ® Advanced Tic-Tac-Toe in Java  

## Project Overview  
-This project is an **Advanced Tic-Tac-Toe Game** built in **Java** as part of my learning journey.  
-It features a **Human vs AI** gameplay mode, where the AI is powered by the **Minimax algorithm** and is designed to be unbeatable.  
-The project helped me strengthen my **Java fundamentals**, improve **problem-solving skills**, and apply **algorithmic thinking** in a real-world scenario.
